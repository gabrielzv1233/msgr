  <h1>How dose it work</h1>
  <p>well to start this is a simple chatting platform, with no authentication, and no way to delete your messages yourself (sorry)</p>
  <p>Spam will be deleted and methods of bypassing chat filters will be patched and messages using these methods may be modifyed to comply with filters</p>
<p>time will show up as the time on the server not your time, Time is shown as the time of the server</p>
  <p>by using this app you understand that anyone can use any username, messages may be edited by anyone who has acsess to the repo (devs, owner)</p>
  <p>Devs, and owners will have gold names with a checkmark</p>
<p>you can go to <a href="/full">/full</a> to see the chat in fullscreen or you can use the API to get the text use /api/get, this will display the text formatted (it will look like the fullscreen page but without extra stuff) or u can go to <a href="/api/get/raw"> and this will show it in raw text (meaning everything that is stored will be shown the way it is</a></p>
<p>to make ur own chatroom, create a new repl on replit, and import https://github.com/gabrielzv1233/msgr/ from github (press import from github and put gabrielzv1233/msgr in the textbox for where to import from) then name it and make sure the project is python.</p><br>
<h2 style="color:red;">DO NOT SHARE YOUR UUID UNLESS IF THE OWNER ASKS, IF THEY DO ASK ONLY SEND IN PRIVATE DMs</h2><h4> (UUIDs cannot share personal information it just identifys the user and hackers can spoof there UUID allowing them to change their username colors to yours if you have one)</h4>
